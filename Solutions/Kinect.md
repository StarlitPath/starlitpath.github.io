# Kinect
While Kinect is not highly regarded by many users, it is nonetheless a competent solution that is highly functional with the right software and setup.

To quote from the K2VR team:
> If you want perfect tracking and wanna breakdance and backflip like none other, Kinect isn't for you. But if you want to sit down, do jumping jacks, walk about your huge playspace or anything of the sort, Kinect is wonderful.

**Overall Price:** $20-$40+

### Requirements:
* Xbox 360 or Xbox One Kinect with power/USB adapter to plug into wall and computer
  * Warning: Xbox One Kinect is NOT recommended. While newer, it is known to be incredibly problematic. Refer to here: https://docs.k2vr.tech/en/one/common-issues/
  * Note: If purchasing adapter separately, avoid purchasing one from Amazon. Those adapters are known to have trouble.
  * Xbox 360+Adapter: Roughly $20.
  * Xbox One+Adapter: Roughly $30-$40+.
* Optional alternative: 3-4 Playstation Eye Cameras and 3 Playstation Move Controllers, should not be used unless you already own the relevant hardware.
* K2EX or Amethyst(Both free)
  * K2EX: https://k2vr.tech/index.html

### Note from Project Lead of K2EX and Amethyst:
> As of writing, K2EX and Amethyst have similar tracking quality (This is going to change drastically in the future). While still in active development and only out in a technical preview, Amethyst is often recommended by the developers because of it's hundreds of bugfixes over the older K2EX app. They just want you to be in their Discord listed below if you run into problems during the preview phase. - Noelle, K2VR Team
