# Surplex
An upcoming full-body method currently on Kickstarter, it uses two shoe-like trackers to track your feet from just rotation alone.

**Overall price:** $169-$339

### Requirements:
* The Surplex Basic or Pro model
  * Surplex Basic: $169-$199 Kickstarter, $266 retail
  * Surplex Pro: $199-$239 Kickstarter, $339 retail
* Optional: Separate hip tracker supported but unnecessary for more fine-tuned hip-tracking.
* Surplex Software: Not currently available to download

### Thoughts:
* While early demos were not very good at demonstrating what the team seeks to accomplish, more recent demos have shown a lot of improvement and a good proof of concept.
* As of this writing, hip tracking latency is still an issue, though this can be mitigated with a dedicated hip tracker if desired according to the team.
