Thoughts:
* While early demos were not very good at demonstrating what the team seeks to accomplish, more recent demos have shown a lot of improvement and a good proof of concept.
* As of this writing, hip tracking latency is still an issue, though this can be mitigated with a dedicated hip tracker if desired according to the team.
