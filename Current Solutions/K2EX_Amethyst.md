# K2EX / Amethyst

Overall Price: $20-$40+

Requirements:
* Xbox 360 or Xbox One Kinect with power/USB adapter to plug into wall and computer
  * Warning: Xbox One Kinect is NOT recommended. While newer, it is known to be incredibly problematic. Refer to here: https://docs.k2vr.tech/en/one/common-issues/
  * Note: If purchasing adapter separately, avoid purchasing from Amazon. Those adapters are known to have trouble.
  * Xbox 360+Adapter: Roughly $20
  * Xbox One+Adapter: Roughly $30-$40+
* Optional alternative: 3-4 Playstation Eye Cameras and 3 Playstation Move Controllers, should not be used unless you already own the relevant hardware.
* K2EX or Amethyst
  * K2EX: https://k2vr.tech/index.html
  * Amethyst: https://github.com/KinectToVR
  * The difference between the two is that Amethyst is as-of-yet not fully released software. However, it is the one recommended to get set up with since it is the focus nowadays.

* Note from Project Lead:
"As of writing, K2EX and Amethyst have similar tracking quality (This is going to change drastically in the future). While still in active development and only out in a technical preview, Amethyst is often recommended by the developers because of it's hundreds of bugfixes over the older K2EX app. They just want you to be in their Discord listed below if you run into problems during the preview phase."

Thoughts:
* The team of KinectToVR have really brought out the hidden potential of the Kinect hardware. While the Kinect is not perfect and nor is the method, this team has improved upon the software dramatically, and have proven that competent Full-Body Tracking can be done on the cheap, and is worth a shot.
* As the team states clearly concerning who this is for: “If you want perfect tracking and wanna breakdance and backflip like none other, Kinect isn't for you. But if you want to sit down, do jumping jacks, walk about your huge playspace or anything of the sort, Kinect is wonderful.”
* There is another software called Driver4VR that has Kinect support, but is not recommended. It can be found on Steam for $17.99.
