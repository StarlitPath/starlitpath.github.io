title: Base Stations + Vive Trackers
parent: Current Solutions
---

Requirements:
* Two Base Station 1.0 or 2.0â€™s and a mounting solution for them
  * Base Station 1.0: Roughly $200
  * Base Station 2.0: Roughly $400
  * Mounting solutions vary. You can technically put them on tables or bookshelves, but this part is completely up to you. Follow official guides to make the best determinations concerning this.
* Vive Trackers 2.0 or 3.0 with trackstraps to put them on you
  * Vive Trackers 2.0 with trackstraps: Overpriced on market. Not recommended unless you can find the trackers for cheaper.
  * Vive Trackers 3.0 with trackstraps: Roughly $500, depends on where you purchase in what condition.
* OpenVR Space Calibrator
  * Github page: https://github.com/pushrax/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator
  * Discord page: https://discord.gg/m7g2Wyj
* 3+ USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports(or a good USB hub for organization)

Overall price: $700-$900

Thoughts:
* The price commanded for doing this combined with the price you paid for the Quest 2 does not make for a good value proposition. If you are fine with base stations, you would likely get a cheaper better experience purchasing a PCVR headset kit that comes with the base stations already.
* If you do decide to do so, OpenVR Space Calibrator is an impressive piece of software with active helpers on the Discord server. Recalibration is common however.
