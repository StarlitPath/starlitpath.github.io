# Base Stations + Vive Trackers
Despite the fact HTC makes the trackers, you can use them with any headset given you add [compatible](#remarks) base stations to your setup.

### Requirements:
* Two Base Stations 1.0 or 2.0 and a mounting solution for them (2.0 stations come with wall mounting hardware included)
  * Base Station 1.0: Roughly $200
  * Base Station 2.0: Roughly $400
  * Mounting solutions vary. You can technically put them on tables or bookshelves, but this part is completely up to you. Follow official guides to make the best determinations concerning this.
* Vive Trackers 2.0 or 3.0 with trackstraps to put them on you
  * Vive Trackers 2.0 with trackstraps: Overpriced on market. Not recommended unless you can find the trackers for cheaper.
  * Vive Trackers 3.0 with trackstraps: Roughly $500, depends on where you purchase in what condition.
* OpenVR Space Calibrator
  * Github page: https://github.com/pushrax/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator
  * Discord page: https://discord.gg/m7g2Wyj
* 3+ USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports(or a good USB hub for organization)

Overall price: $700-$900

### Thoughts:
The price of the entire setup, when added on top of buying a Quest 2, does not make for a good value proposition.

If you haven't got a headset yet, you would likely get a cheaper better experience purchasing a PCVR headset kit that comes with the base stations already.

If you do decide to do so, OpenVR Space Calibrator is an impressive piece of software with active helpers on the Discord server. Recalibration is common however.
