The content of the website was drafted by StarlitPath, an active user of the VR community who seeks to help shed light on topics of confusion and be a star to guide others through the virtual reality.

Contributions to this website with the logo, overall construction and formatting help, and review of and aid with content was done by the lovely amazing Noelle, who I love very much. <3
