# Contributors

The content of the website was originally drafted by StarlitPath, an active user of the VR community who seeks to help shed light on topics of confusion and be a star to guide others through the virtual reality.

Logo creation, formatting and construction help, and overall editing and extensive elaborations, cleanup and modifications done by the talented lovely known as Noelle, who I love very much. <3
